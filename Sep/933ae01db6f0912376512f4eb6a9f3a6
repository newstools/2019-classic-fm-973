Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and the leadership of the House have unanimously okayed a revocation of old diplomatic arrangements with South Africa that make attacks on Nigerians possible. In a joint press conference in Abuja, the Speaker who led the leadership said that it was time for action and not the usual talks.  He said that the House would explore all possible means to seek redress to the injustice meted against Nigerians in South Africa. He said: â€œWe do not intend to speak many words here today. The time for speaking has long passed, and the time for action has arrived upon us with a fierce urgency demanding nothing less than our total commitment to revoking the old arrangements that have made such abominations against our people possible.
