The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, has today clarified that the proposed increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% would not negatively affect the common Nigerian contrary to speculations that it will impose significant burden on the private sector and the average Nigerian who are already grappling with multiple taxations.  Fielding questions from journalists in Abuja, the Minister explained that VAT is a Consumption tax which is not applicable on food, education, medicaments, transports adding that only 15% is accruable to Federal Government while 85% is for States and Local Governments to shore up its revenue base. She said the Federal Government is committed to a prudent budget expenditure while it’s made provision for economic zones by providing basic infrastructures for private sectors/investors to set up businesses to thrive.  Reacting to the surge in the global oil price and its effect on the Nigerian economy and 2020 Budget proposal, the Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Mr Clement Agba said the Federal Government would maintain status quo on the benchmark oil price of 50dollars in the 2020 budget and continue to monitor global market trends.
