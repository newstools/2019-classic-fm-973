Madagascar has pulled out of Saturdayâ€™s planned friendly match hastily arranged by the South African Football Association after their initial opponent Zambia pulled out of the friendly a few days ago. The Bafana Bafana were originally set to face Zambia in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia as part of their warm-up fixtures before their AFCON qualifiers in November but the match was cancelled on Tuesday after Zambia withdrew citing xenophobic attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa. The South African Football Association (SAFA) hastily arranged a replacement with Madagascar and even announced free entry for supporters attending the fixture at Orlando Stadium in Soweto.
