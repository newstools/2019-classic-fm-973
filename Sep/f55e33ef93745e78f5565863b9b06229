President Muhammadu Buhari has Thursday assured Nigerians that the Federal Government will not inflict additional hardship on citizens, rather it will keep seeking ways to ameliorate their sufferings and create a more enabling environment for everyone to thrive.  President Buhari told  the new executive of Trade Union Congress led by its President, Comrade Quadri Olaleye, at the State House that the Federal Government remains committed to the implementation of the national minimum wage, pointing out that the inaugural Federal Executive Council meeting held yesterday focused on the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, which included discussions around the new minimum wage.  President Buhari, who noted that his administration will work hard to improve the livelihood of citizens, said most of the inherited challenges were avoidable, if some previous governments had been keener on investing on infrastructure and human capacity. Speaking further with State House Correspondent after the meeting, The Minister of Labor and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige said Mr President assured the Union of better welfare adding that a Presidential Committee on Salaries (PSC) would be launched on Friday.  In his remarks, TUC President urged the Federal Government to pay more attention on the welfare of Nigerians by avoiding increase of fuel price and ensuring implementation of the National Minimum Wage, which had been delayed by negotiations on the consequential adjustments as well as focus on poverty reduction and improving security.  Reacting on the proposed VAT increase to 7.2percent by the Federal Government, he said the Union has begun deliberations on it as the TUC would also consult with the government on the matter in due course.
