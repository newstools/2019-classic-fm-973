Cardiff City have been told to pay a transfer fee of 6m euros (£5.3m) to Nantes for Emiliano Sala. A Fifa panel met to rule on a dispute between the clubs, who had failed to reach agreement on settling payment for the striker. The Argentine, who was 28, died in a plane crash in January while travelling from France to join his new club. Cardiff had argued they were not liable for the £15m fee because Sala was not officially their player when he died.
