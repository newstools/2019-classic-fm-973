The Lagos State Government has warned youths against deviant and other anti-social behavior that will impede their progress in life. The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Segun Dawodu gave the warning at the opening of IBILE Youth Academy (IYA) for about five hundred youths in the state.  Ibile Youth Academy is designed to inculcate in its participants the virtues of citizenship, leadership and volunteerism for the development of their personality, society, the state and by extension the nation.  Dawodu, whose speech was read by the Permanent Secretary, Yewande Falugba said the training was meant to help youths gain greater understanding of leaders’ responsibility; improved abilities to communicate with their peers and adults; improved ability to understand and contribute to the State’s vision and policies and harness the power of positive thinking which would influence them to achieve greatness in every level.  Dawodu explained that at the end of the five days, the best 10 participants from each of the five Divisions would proceed on a camping exercise at the end of which the best participant would be named “State Youth Ambassador 2019”.  Our Correspondent Immanuel Odeyemi quotes Permanent Secretary, Youth and Social Development, Falugba whose speech was read by the Director, Human Resource and Administration, Mr. Segun Ajayi, as saying the Academy’s emphasis was on learning strategies based upon fun, play, action group and individual challenges teaching life skills rather than academic lessons.
