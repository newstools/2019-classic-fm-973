Cardiff City have decided to appeal against Fifa's ruling that they must pay the first instalment of 6m euros (£5.3m) to Nantes for £15m striker Emiliano Sala. The Bluebirds will challenge the ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. Cardiff and Nantes have since been in dispute over fee payments.  The Argentine, who was 28, died in a plane crash in January while travelling from France to join his new club. Cardiff have argued they were not liable for any of the full £15m fee because Sala was not officially their player when he died. The club refused to make interim payments, claiming the deal was not legally binding.  Nantes argued that having signed with Cardiff, Sala's contract with Nantes was over and that he had become a Cardiff player. Cardiff recruited Sala while they were in the Premier League and have since been relegated to the Championship. The Bluebirds believe the transfer was null and void, saying the Premier League had rejected certain clauses requested by Nantes in the original contract and that Sala never had a chance to review or sign the final version, meaning their record signing was not registered as a Premier League player.
