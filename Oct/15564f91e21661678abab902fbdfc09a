State Governors have again expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed plan by the Federal Government on the monthly repayment of N162 million of its budget support facility to the states despite an extension of repayment duration from twenty to thirty years.  The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja disclosed that the Federal Government has made N252 million monthly deductions in September and October from state government accounts, based on the twenty years repayment period.  According to her, following the outcry of state governors, another repayment schedule plan extending the year to thirty years with interest rate of 9percent and monthly repayment of N162 million was presented to the Council on Tuesday but this was again rejected by the governors. She noted that further consultations will be made with the governors, the Central Bank of Nigeria who is the lender and the Finance Ministry to further revise the repayment conditions so as to reduce the repayment burden.  Meanwhile, the Minister, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has said the federal government would still enforce on the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the directives by President Muhammadu Buhari for all public sector workers to be registered on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, (IPPIS) notwithstanding the threat by the academic union to embark on a nationwide strike by November 5th.  Responding to questions by newsmen after the NEC meeting at the Presidential Villa, Mrs Zainab said though her Ministry will engage with ASUU but would still have to comply with the Presidential directives. Our State House Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Minister disclosed that as at 22nd of October, the Excess crude account has a balance of 324million dollars, stabilization funds account has 28billion naira, natural resource development fund has account balance of 70billion naira.
