After the racial abuse which included Nazi salutes and monkey chants on England players on Monday, the Bulgarian prime minister has called for the head of the country's football association to resign.  Boyko Borissov "strongly condemned" the behaviour showcased at the European qualifier in Sofia . The match, which England won 6-0, was paused twice because of racist behaviour by home fans.  The British government is writing to Uefa on Tuesday to demand more action. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has seen the footage and he thinks it is "vile and has no place in football or anywhere else".  Bulgarian Prime Minister Borissov called his nation "one of the most tolerant countries in the world" but said it is "unacceptable" people there connect with racism and xenophobia. "I call on Borislav Mihaylov to immediately resign as president of the Bulgarian Football Union," he said. "After yesterday's shameful loss of the Bulgarian National Team and given the bad results of our football, I ordered to end any relationship with BFU, including financial, until the withdrawal of Borislav Mihaylov from the post." England forward Raheem Sterling tweeted to describe the call for Mihaylov to resign as a "good move".  The Vasil Levski Stadium was already subject to a partial closure for the match after Bulgaria were sanctioned for racist behaviour during Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic. Before the match, BFU president Mihaylov had complained to Uefa about "unjust branding" after the build-up was overshadowed by fears England's players could be subjected to abuse. Mihaylov, a former Reading goalkeeper, played at three World Cups for Bulgaria and is a member of Uefa's executive committee.
