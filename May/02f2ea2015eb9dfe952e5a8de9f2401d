President Muhammadu Buhari was Wednesday sworn in for a second term as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Acting Chief Justice of the Federation, Justice Mohammed Tanko, administered the oath of office to the President, shortly after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo took his oath of office at the Eagle Square in Abuja.  The 2019 low-key presidential inauguration, which held at the Eagle Square, was heralded by a colourful military parade which received the service chiefs, CJN, Vice President and President as they arrived. Soon after the swearing-in, there was the lowering and hoisting of National and Defence flags and 21-gun salutes. Afterwards, the president inspected the Guard of Honour and acknowledged cheers from the guests. However, President Buhari did not deliver an inaugural speech as expected from a democratically elected leader, first in the history of Nigeria.   Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the inauguration ceremony was attended by many top government officials including the Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, the Wives of the President and Vice, and other important dignitaries.
