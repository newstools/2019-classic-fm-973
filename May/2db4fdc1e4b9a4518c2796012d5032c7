BBC thriller Killing Eve was the big winner at the Bafta TV Awards, scooping three trophies including best actress for Jodie Comer and best drama series. The ceremony took place at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Sunday.  I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here and Britain's Got Talent also picked up prizes, despite Ant McPartlin taking time out from both series last year. BGT won best entertainment show and I'm A Celebrity won the reality prize.  Benedict Cumberbatch won best actor for his drama Patrick Melrose, which was also named best mini-series. The Sherlock star, who received his first of seven previous Bafta nominations in 2005 but hasn't won until now, told the audience: "Oh gosh, I think I'm going to fall over, I'm very used to being a bridesmaid not the bride."  In Killing Eve, Comer played offbeat assassin Villanelle, who was pursued by intelligence agent Eve, played by Sandra Oh. Both were nominated for best actress. Accepting the award, a tearful Comer - who dedicated her award to her late grandmother - said: "Thank you so much. Sorry, I'm the only one who's turned on the waterworks."  Paying tribute to the show's writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, she said: "I feel so lucky to say I worked with you, also to call you a friend. You're the most talented person I know, also an inspiration."  Fiona Shaw was named best supporting actress for playing spy boss Carolyn Martens, a role she said had been "probably the greatest pleasure of my life". She also expressed gratitude to Waller-Bridge and her "glass-shattering genius and wayward imagination".  Killing Eve's inclusion this year was unusual, in that Bafta bent the rules to allow it to be nominated.  The Bafta Craft Awards which recognise behind-the-scenes talent like writers and sound editors took place last month, with A Very English Scandal going home with the most trophies.
