The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has concluded plans to commence a verification exercise for Nigerians who “invested” monies with Dantata Success and Profitable Company, Kano.  According to the SEC, as part of the arrangements to commence a refund of their monies, the verification exercise will take place from Friday May 31st to Sunday June 2 from 9am to 4pm daily, to ascertain the level of their commitment to the company.  Recall that The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), with a view to protecting investors on 6th February 2019 sealed up the business premises of Dantata Success and Profitable Company (DSPC) following the company’s involvement in unlawful solicitation of funds from the public with a promise of inexplicable high returns to investors. The Commission further warns the public to exercise utmost caution before subscribing to investment schemes.
