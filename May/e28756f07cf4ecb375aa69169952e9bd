President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has called on Muslim faithful to pray for a positive turn around in the fortunes of Nigeria as they join their counterparts across the world to observe this year's Ramadan fasting. Saraki, in a goodwill message, to mark the beginning of the holy month, signed by his Special Adviser (Media and Publicity), Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja, noted that since fasting symbolizes internal cleansing and spiritual renewal, the country can benefit tremendously from the prayers of the faithful during the period.  He said: “It is my prayer that Allah accepts the earnest prayers and sacrifices of the Muslim Ummah  during this Holy Month. May we emerge better, both at the individual and national levels, after this spiritual exercise. “Let’s us seek an end to recurring killings, kidnapping and all forms of insecurity in our country. As community leaders and members of the Islamic faith, we have a responsibility to work for peace in our communities in particular, and the country in general. “We cannot afford to gloss over the present level of insecurity and harsh economic realities in our country. Therefore, let us pray earnestly for Allah’s intervention in the socio-economic life of our people,” he stated.  Saraki also called on all leaders both at the national and state levels to put in place policies and programmes that would directly benefit the people and gainfully engage the nation’s growing youth population. He added that the high youth population in the country is a blessing as the young people can hasten the development process if positively engaged but that the advantage can also become a time bomb if they are not well managed and deployed for good causes.
