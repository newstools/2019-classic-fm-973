The Senate today confirmed Mr Godwin Emefiele for another five-year tenure as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  This followed the adoption of report of the Committee on Banking Insurance and Other Financial Institutions at plenary presented by the Chairman Senator Rafiu Ibrahim expressing the committee’s satisfaction with Mr Emefiele’s outstanding performance.  President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki congratulated the CBN boss while urging him to use his second tenure to improve the economy after the Lawmakers confirmed Mr Emefiele in a unanimous voice.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that President Muhammadu Buhari had on May 8th written to the Senate requesting that Emefiele be confirmed as CBN Governor for a second term of five years.  Meanwhile, the Upper Chamber has passed a Bill confirming June 12 as Democracy Day. The Public Holiday Act (amendment bill 2004) which is one of six House Bills up for concurrence on the floor of the Senate at plenary seeks to make June 12 as the new Democracy Day to replace May 29, which marks the official handing over of military to civilian administration.  Senate passage of the Public Holiday Act (Amendment) Bill which now finally confirms June 12 as Democracy Day comes on the heels of an announcement by the Nigerian government that the erstwhile Democracy Day Celebration of 29th May 2019 will be merely for the inauguration of the President-elect, an event that will be low-keyed.
