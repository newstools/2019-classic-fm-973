The Wu-Tang Clan will be releasing new music on Friday, May 17. The legendary group has revealed plans for an EP inspired by Showtime’s Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics And Men documentary series, which premiered last Friday.  “You’ve seen episode 1 of the Wu documentary by now (and if you haven’t, what were you doing last weekend), now listen to the music inspired by the series,” the group announced on social media. “On Friday, we’re coming with a new Wu-Tang EP from @36Chambers and Mass Appeal, so let your boss know you’ll be in late to work. #wutang #wutangclan #ofmicsandmen #36chambers.”  Wu-Tang haven’t released a project together  at least for public consumption since 2014’s A Better Tomorrow. Their rare Once Upon a Time in Shaolin album, which was created by Wu-Tang affiliate Cilvaringz, was sold at auction in 2015. Controversial businessman Martin Shkreli, who was later convicted on securities fraud charges, bought the lone copy for $2 million.  More recently, all of the living Wu-Tang members except U-God contributed to a 2017 compilation titled The Saga Continues. The LP was put together by the group’s longtime DJ and producer Mathematics.
