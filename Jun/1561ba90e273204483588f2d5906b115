There is palpable tension and fear as Senators- elect have commenced voting for either the Senate Leader in the 8th, Senator Ahmad Lawan, APC, Yobe North or the former Senate Leader and a strong contender for the position of Senate President for the 9th Senate, Senator Ali Ndume, APC, Borno South. There is palpable fear in the Hallowed Chamber as the voting commenced, apparently due to the fact that the move to use the open ballot system as being canvassed for by the Senator Lawan led group did not sail through. The Senators- elect are using the open Secret ballot system where they are given a ballot paper, go to the cubicle to vote secretly for their preferred candidates and then drop it in the ballot box.

The chamber had erupted into a rowdy one soon after the Clerk to the National Assembly, CNA, Mohammed Sani Omolori declared that he did not get the Order from the Court stopping the Senate from using the 2015 Standing Orders as Amended.  According to him, if there was any court order, there was no reason why he will not respect it, stressing that he did not get such. At exactly 10am, Omolori told the Senators- elect that the Standing Orders which says Secret ballot system would be used for the election of the Presiding Officers. Immediately after the announcement, the hallowed Chamber was thrown into a confused one, following shouts from Barau Jibrin, others who were against the decision to use that of 2015. Omolori had to call them to order, telling them that today, no motion shall be moved or taken as the business of the day is only that of inauguration and election of Presiding Officers.  On the question on whether he got the Order, Omolori said No and that he only answered because for Barau Jibrin.
