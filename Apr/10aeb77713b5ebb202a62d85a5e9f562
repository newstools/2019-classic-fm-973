The Senate has directed its committee on Youth and Sports to investigate the appointment of Brig Gen S. Ibrahim  as the new Director General (DG) of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) by the Chief of Army Staff, against the provision of the Agency Act.  This was sequel to a point of order moved by Senator Dino Melaye during today's plenary who submitted that Ibrahim’s posting as new NYSC DG was illegally done as the army does not have the power to appoint a Director-General for the NYSC. It will be recalled that the Nigerian army had announced Brig Gen S. Ibrahim as the new director-general (DG) of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to take over from Suleiman Kazaure, the current NYSC DG, with immediate effect in a signal sent by chief of army staff.  The lawmakers argued that Nigerian Army violated the law in appointment of new NYSC DG, adding that such power is exclusive of the president and commander-in-chief of Nigeria’s armed forces as provided for in the NYSC act, which is the scheme’s enabling act. The President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, who presided over the plenary however gave the Senate Committee on Sports and Youths Development three weeks to investigate and report back to the house their findings.  Meanwhile, the Senate has adjourned plenary till Tuesday 6th April, 2019 and also summoned the Inspector General of police, to appear at 11am same day to brief the senate on the spate of increasing insecurity challenges across the country.
