Association for Public Policy Analysis, APPA, said, Wednesday, $29.635 billion (about 6.52 trillion) had been spent in the power sector in the last 16 years without commensurate evidence on the ground. President of APPA, Princewill Okorie, who disclosed this at a media interactive session in Abuja, said in spite of the huge expenditure, Nigerians spent over N796.4 billion annually on fuel to power generators.  According to him, “it is also estimated that Nigerians spent $13 billion to purchase generators to solve their industrial, commercial and domestic problems in 2016.” He recalled that Olusegun  Obasanjo administration spent $16 billion (N 3.52 trillion). Yar’Adua administration spent $5.375 billion (N 1.183 trillion) and Goodluck Jonathan spent $ 8.2 billion (N1.817 trillion).  According to him, “During Dimeji Bankole investigation of power sector at House of Representatives, it was discovered that about 2,500 containers of imported power equipment worth about $5 billion were abandoned at Lagos port and it attracted demurrage valued at N4 billion.”  Okorie also revealed that the Central Bank of Nigeria under its Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Funds, NEMSF, set up in December 2014, planned to inject N213.41 billion into the power sector for the purpose of settling outstanding payment obligations due to market participants, service providers and Gas suppliers under the interim rules period. He said: “Of the amount pronounced, N120.2 billion was disbursed to various qualified market participants before the fund was suspended as a result of operating technical issues. N61 billion could be contributed by the World Bank’s programme for results. Part of the funds will go towards a performance-based loan to enable the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Company to pay 100 per cent of its wholesale invoices in full and on time.
