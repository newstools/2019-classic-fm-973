Speaking on behalf of the governors, the Chairman of the South West Governors Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu said that the Technical Committee had submitted its recommendation to the governors and will start the implementation by August.  The governors in the region met behind closed doors in Akure, to review the security situations in the states. Akeredolu said: “the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria, DAWN, Commission is going back to do some work for us, and thereafter, we will all implement it and ensure that there is security of lives and properties in western Nigeria. We are assuring our people that we are prepared and determined to deal ruthlessly with anyone found within the South West region perpetrating any criminal act.”
