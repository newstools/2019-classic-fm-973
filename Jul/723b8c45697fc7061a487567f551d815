The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has aligned with Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s call in urging the people of South-East geopolitical zone to rise and defend themselves. In a statement by the Chairman of CAN, South-East, Bishop Giddy Okafor, and Secretary, Reverend Scamb Nwokolo, the Christian body, however, commended the Federal Government for suspending the controversial RUGA project.  The statement formed part of the communiqué issued by CAN after its emergency meeting in Enugu. It declared that “the Federal Government should not implement, in any form, any programme that shall lead to anarchy in this country. We reject, condemn and oppose any form of forceful appropriation of an individual or communal land to herdsmen or cattle nomads in the guise of Executive Order, Act, law or Federal Government programme in Nigeria, and the South-East in particular. Cattle rearing is a private business, so the Federal Government should not induce crisis or create undue tension when South-East is still recovering from the havoc of the civil war and does  not wish such to happen again in any form.”  CAN urge Ndigbo not to panic “regarding the threat from some northern groups led by one Abdulazeez. Our land shall never be taken by force by anybody in any guise. Let us continue to pray and watch. Let everybody be prepared to defend themselves as directed by Ohanaeze Ndigbo.”
