Aston Villa have signed Brentford defender Ezri Konsa in a £12m deal. "He's a high-potential player who I believe can step up to the Premier League and I'm really looking forward to working with him again," said Smith.  The 21-year-old had been a key target for Villa boss Dean Smith, who managed the England Under-21 centre-back when he was in charge of the Bees. Konsa played 47 times for Brentford after a £2.5m move from Charlton in 2018. Konsa will join up with the Villa squad on Thursday when they fly to the United States to continue their pre-season work.  Villa have prioritised strengthening their defence having also signed Tyrone Mings, 26, from Bournemouth while still exploring the possibility of re-signing Manchester United's Axel Tuanzebe, 21, on loan. Tuanzebe helped Villa to promotion back to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs.  Since promotion, Villa have signed Mings for £20m, defender Kortney Hause from Wolves, winger Anwar El Ghazi from Lille, left-back Matt Targett from Southampton, forward Wesley from Club Brugge and midfielder Jota from Birmingham. Smith's side start their Premier League season away at Tottenham on 10 August.
