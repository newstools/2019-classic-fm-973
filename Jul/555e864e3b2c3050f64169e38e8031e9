Two Premier League footballers have been involved in a carjacking attempt by an armed gang in a London street. Arsenal players Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac were targeted, the club confirmed, but both escaped uninjured. Arsenal said in a statement: "We have been in contact with both players and they are fine."  Footage on social media appears to show Kolasinac chasing the robbers in Platts Lane, near Golders Green, at about 17:00 BST. In a video that has circulated on social media, full-back Kolasinac is seen fighting off two men who are wielding knives. The player can be seen jumping out of a vehicle to confront the masked men who had pulled alongside the car on mopeds.  In the footage, both carjackers were seen to be armed and were filmed brandishing knives at 26-year-old Kolasinac. A 46 year old eyewitness, Simon Collins , of Golders Green said he saw two men on mopeds chasing the wagon on Finchley Road. “They had roof tiles in their hands and were all blacked up, ninja-style. I think the intention was to smash the tiles through the wagon window. They were proper masked up, nasty types with no plates on the mopeds.”   Broadcaster and Arsenal fan Piers Morgan tweeted that Kolašinac should be made captain with “immediate effect following the incident”.
