The Federal Government has today charged insurance operators not to fight against the recapitalization policy which is aimed at deepening insurance penetration and developing the industry.  Speaking at the on-going 2019 National Insurance Conference in Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Finance, Dr. Mahmoud Isa-Dutse, said that the government will continue to support the industry to achieve 40percent financial inclusion rate by the year 2020 and to enable it contribute effectively to economic growth.  The Commissioner for Insurance, Mr Mohammed Kari, said in order to remain relevant and become a critical contributor to the national economy, the industry must consciously be digitally proactive and organized so as to take advantage of the opportunities provided by these disruptive developments while at the same time curbing their corresponding negative impacts.  The Chairman, Insurance Industry Consultative Council (IICC), Eddie Efekoha, called on the National Insurance Commission to give favorable consideration to the suggestions made by the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) in their on-going engagements on the recapitalization.  The Director-General of the Budget Office, Ben Akabueze, in his remarks also implored insurance operators to embrace the recapitalisation and ensure they revise the notion that they are the poor cousins of the banks.
