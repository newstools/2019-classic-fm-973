Dame Sarah Connolly has pulled out of performances at English National Opera and the BBC Proms after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The mezzo-soprano, who was made a dame in 2017, said "imminent surgery" left her unable to attend the concerts."I hope, however, to fulfil all of my other concert and recording commitments over the coming months," she added.   The star's illustrious career has included appearances at Glyndebourne and the Last Night of the Proms. She had been due to star in the ENO's Orpheus and Eurydice, which is choreographer Wayne McGregor's opera directing debut, this October. Alice Coote will step in to play the role of Orpheus, while Julie Boulianne will now take her place at the BBC Proms, singing Berlioz's The Childhood of Christ.
