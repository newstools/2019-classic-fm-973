The embattled Senator representing Adamawa North Senatorial District, Senator Elisha Abbo, has apologised to Nigerians, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the victim and women in general, following a viral video in which he was seen physically assaulting a lady.  Senator Abbo who tendered the apology at a press conference at the PDP headquarters in Abuja assured Nigerians, especially the youth of Adamawa North, of his good conduct at all time. The Senator who was emotional at the briefing asked for forgiveness, saying it is not in his character to assault women.  The lawmakerâ€™s action has been widely condemned including by Amnesty International and opposition presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and many other prominent Nigerians. Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Senate had earlier on Wednesday set up an adhoc committee to investigate and submit a report on the assault within two-weeks.
