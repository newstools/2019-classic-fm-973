Four Turkish nationals were abducted at a local drinking joint at Gbale village,  Edu Local Government Area of Kwara State, Saturday night. The spokesman of the Kwara State Police Command, Ajayi Okasanmi, said the Commissioner of Police had dispatched men of Operation Puff Adder to rescue the captives and arrest the captors.  This comes barely one week after a cargo ship was attacked off the coast of Nigeria and 10 Turkish sailors kidnapped. The four captives, identified as Yasin Colak, 33; Senerapal, 40; Ergun Yurdakul, 35 and Seyit Keklik, 25, were said to be working with Instabul concrete limited, Gbale.  The Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, in a statement by his spokesman, Rafiu Ajakaye, said he was working with the security agencies to ensure the rescue of the abductees. The governor urged for calm.
