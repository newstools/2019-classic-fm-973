In a bid to reduce the burden of multiple registration of taxpayers, in line with the ease of doing business and ease of paying tax, the new Tax Payers Identification Number TIN registration System has been flagged-off by the Federal Government.  The Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo who flagged-off the new TIN Registration System initiated by the Joint Tax Board today in Abuja said the initiative would bring innovation, convenience and transparency totax authorities and taxpayers.  The Chairman, Joint Tax Board (JTB), Mr Tunde Fowler, however said that the Internally Generated Revenue of the 36 states and FCT rose from N800 billion in 2016 to N1.16 trillion in 2018. Fowler further noted that the new JTB TIN is developed with the objective of integrating with relevant agencies and leverage on already captured data in order to reduce the burden of manual data sorting.  Our correspondent Nathan Williams reports that the Executive Secretary of the Board, Mr Oseni Elamah, said the new TIN system would reduce the burden of multiple registration of taxpayers and could conveniently be registered and verified online thereby promoting transparency.
