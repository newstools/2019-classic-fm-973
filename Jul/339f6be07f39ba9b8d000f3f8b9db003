Norwich City have signed right-back Sam Byram from Premier League rivals West Ham United for Â£750,000. The Englishman joins the newly promoted Canaries on a four-year deal and is their fourth summer signing. "I had a nasty injury last year and it was nice to finish the season with a couple of games. This feels like a new chapter, a fresh start," said Byram.  Byram spent last season on loan at Championship side Nottingham Forest, but made only eight appearances because of a knee injury. He started his career at Leeds United, scoring 10 goals in 143 appearances, before moving to West Ham in January 2016. He featured 36 times for the Hammers.
