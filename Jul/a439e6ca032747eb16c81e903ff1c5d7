In view of constant complaints of poor service and drop calls on the part of telecoms network providers in Nigeria, the Senate has directed the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) to effectively supervise telecom companies to ensure improved quality service.  This was part of resolutions reached on a motion raised during plenary today by the Senator representing Oyo Central, Buhari Abdulfatai and 34 other lawmakers calling on the Upper chamber to wade into the matter, adding that the telecoms providers have not invested enough to improve their quality of service.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the lawmakers contributing heaped the bulk of the blame on the regulatory body for not acting up to expectations. While ruling on the motion, the President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan says it will no longer be business as usual, as ineffective  network operators may have to be blacklisted if need be.  The Senate has also directed the NCC to invoke appropriate provisions of the law to protect consumers and refund cost of disrupted calls.
