A fire aboard a Russian navy research submersible has killed 14 crew members, the Russian defence ministry says. It says the crew members were poisoned by fumes when the vessel caught fire while taking biometric measurements in Russian territorial waters on Monday. An investigation into the incident has begun under the commander-in-chief of the navy.  The fire was later put out and the vessel is now at Severomorsk, the main base of the Russian Northern Fleet in the Murmansk region. The ministry did not say how many crew members were aboard at the time. It also did not specify the type of the submersible.  Submersibles are generally smaller vessels with limited crew on board supported by ships on the surface, while submarines are larger vessels capable of operating autonomously over long distances. The Kursk submarine, which was destroyed by the blasts in the Barents Sea, was also part of the Northern Fleet.
