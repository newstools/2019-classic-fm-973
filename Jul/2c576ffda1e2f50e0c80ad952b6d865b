Nigeria beat Tunisia to win third place at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. Ighalo, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, tapped in after keeper Moez Ben Cherifia deflected the ball off his own defender Yassine Meriah with the only goal of the match. Three-time winners Nigeria have now finished third eight times.   In a slow-paced game between the two losing semi-finalists in Cairo, Tunisia went close as Ferjani Sassi and Ghaylene Chaalali shot wide. Tunisia, champions in 2004, needed a finger-tip save from Cherifia to deny Samuel Chukwueze in the second half and the keeper was called on again injury time to acrobatically save Samuel Kalu's free-kick.  Senegal will look for their first Afcon title when they face 1990 winners face Algeria in Friday's final.
