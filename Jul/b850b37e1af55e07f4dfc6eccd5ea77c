Six soldiers, including two officers, who fought to repel a Boko Haram attack, Wednesday evening, were killed by the insurgents. One of the victims was a colonel and another captain.  Several Boko Haram fighters were also killed by the Nigerian soldiers in the attack that occurred at about 6 p.m. along Maiduguri-Damaturu Highway during a patrol by the colonel and other soldiers of the 29 Task Force Brigade. Army has not announced the development and its spokesman, Sagir Musa, has refused to comment on the incident. Also, Premium Times is withholding the identity of the slain officers, saying they were not sure their families had been briefed by the Army.  The military has avoided announcing own casualties in recent months, including the two lieutenant colonels who were killed within the past two months.Â However, a military source said the six soldiers were killed near their base in Jakana. Sources said a soldier who went missing has since returned to base. A reinforcement was sent from the 29 Task Force Brigade Headquarters in Benisheik to the Jakana outpost. The remains of the colonel and five others have been sent to the Nigerian Army medical facility in Maiduguri, Borno State capital.
