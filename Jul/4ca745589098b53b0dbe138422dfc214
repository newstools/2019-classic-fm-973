The Chief Whip of the Senate and former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu has called for equity in the spread of appointments of heads of the major security Parastatals in the country , particularly the Service Chiefs.  The Chief Whip of the Senate while addressing journalists in Abuja said appointments of service chiefs should be spread across the six geo- polical zones according to constitutional provision of one Minister per state adding that a bill may come up in the Senate soon as a way of allaying the fears of marginalisation from any segment of the country.  Speaking on the suspended RUGA settlement proposed by the Federal Government, Senator Orji revealed he pioneered “Ruga” in Abia State when he governed the state between 1999 to 2007. The Chief Whip also revealed that he trades in cows, adding that it was wrong for people to see cow business as exclusively that of the Fulani.  Our Correspondent reports that the Chief Whip opined that the recently suspended policy, was not properly marketed to Nigerians, particularly those in the southern and North Central axis.
