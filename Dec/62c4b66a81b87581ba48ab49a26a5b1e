The Senate has mandated its Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to investigate the recent alleged invasion of court by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to re-arrest the publisher of Sahara-reporters and convener of #RevolutionNow, Omoyele Sowore. This resolution followed a point of order moved by the Senator representing Ekiti Central, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, who drew the attention of the upper chamber to the alleged invasion of a Federal High Court, Abuja, presided over by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu.  Our correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that Senator Opeyemi said that the Senate cannot afford to gloss over the matter as direct representatives of the people and called on it to mandate its committee on National Security and Intelligence to investigate the matter to enable the upper chamber draw conclusion based on facts.  The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his ruling on Senator Opeyemiâ€™s point of order, mandated the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to investigate the alleged invasion of the Federal High Court by DSS operatives. The Committee, which is chaired by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, is expected to turn in its report by next week Thursday.
