The Nigerian Senate has summoned the Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola to appear before its Committees on Interior, Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to brief the upper chamber on the legal and constitutional issues surrounding the implementation of President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s recent visa-on-arrival policy.  The lawmakers reached the decision at plenary after debating on a Point of Order raised by Ekiti North Senator, Olubunmi Adetumbi who expressed concerns of the policy on Nigeria's National security. Some lawmakers (Senators Jubrin Barau, Enyinnanya Abaribe and Ibikunle Amosun) also expressed diverse views on the policy.  In his remarks, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, called on the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to forward all treaties and agreements entered into by the Federal Government to the National Assembly for ratification.
