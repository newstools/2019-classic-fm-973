There is palpable anxiety among management and senior staff of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) as the four-year tenure of the Executive Chairman, Mr Tunde Fowler ended Sunday without a word from the Presidency. Fowler’s tenure is renewable but there has not been any movement in that regard, as at the time of filing this report. President Muhammadu Buhari reserves the right to re-appoint him for the second and final term or replace him.  According to sources the fate of Mr Fowler is uncertain, especially as he had been queried by the Chief of Staff to the President, Mr Abba Kyari, only a few months ago over alleged poor revenue performance. That query, as learnt, was a demonstration that Mr Fowler was not in the good books of the Chief of Staff, who is considered very powerful in the Buhari government. Although Fowler’s response to that query was that the FIRS under him had broken revenue records, it might not be able to swade the powers behind the throne to re-appoint the FIRS boss.  A staff told Vanguard this morning, that Mr Fowler was yet to report to the office this morning and that the organisation was waiting for the president to do whatever pleased him on the matter.
