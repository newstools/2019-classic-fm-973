The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina,has spoken out on a microcosm issue. Reacting to a publication made by PUNCH that it would no longer address Buhari as ‘President but General Buhari’ until his administration purges itself off dictatorial operation, Adesina in a statement released on Wednesday argued that calling President Buhari ‘General’ is a testament that press freedom and freedom of speech are high guaranteed in the country.  His words ‘ANOTHER TESTIMONY TO PRESS FREEDOM IN NIGERIA, BY PRESIDENCY “A newspaper says it will henceforth address President Muhammadu Buhari by his military rank of Major General. Nothing untoward in it. It is a rank the President attained by dint of hard work before he retired from the Nigerian Army. And today, constitutionally, he’s also Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. All over the world, just as in our country, a large number of retired military officers are now democrats. It does not make those who didn’t pass through military service better democrats than them.  Rather than being pejorative, addressing President Buhari by his military rank is another testimony to free speech and freedom of the press, which this administration (or regime, if anyone prefers: it’s a matter of semantics) has pledged to uphold and preserve.”
