Three thousand nine hundred Community Development Associations are expected to participate in this year's Lagos Community Day. The Community Day is a day set aside to appreciate and reward the top three CDAs in Lagos which engage in self-help projects for the development of their Communities.  Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Mrs. Yetunde Arobieke, made this known Wednesday at a Media parley at Alausa, Ikeja. Reeling out the activities for the weeklong event, Mrs. Arobieke said the gesture to reward deserving CDAs was to motivate and encourage other CDAs that dues collected from their members be judiciously used for their Community development. While fielding questions from Journalists, the Commissioner appealed to CDA members in the State to be law abiding and desist from parking vehicles indiscriminately on their streets, stressing that Local officials would tow any vehicle that violates traffic regulations.  On his part, the Chairman House Committee on Local Government and Community Affairs, Mr. Olayiwola Olawale, assured CDAs that the State House of Assembly would continue to enact people oriented policies to bring about rapid development at the grassroots. Our Correspondent Immanuel Odeyemi reports that the theme for this year's Community Day is ‘Revisiting Rural Communities for 21st Century Development’.
