The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, has said that the closure of the countryâ€™s land borders is partly responsible for the increase in inflation.  Responding to questions on inflation increase at 11.61 per cent after the Federal Executive Council presided by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja she noted that the slight increase by 2basis point between September and October is due to food inflation rise which she said will be moderated as the border closure impact fizzles out. She explained that the closure of the borders was a temporary measure adopted by the government to protect the economy against trade malpractices by neighbouring countries.  In addition, The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed also stressed that the increase in inflation is not totally as a result of border closure adding that the gains of the closure far outweighs the loss.  Meanwhile, the minister of finance, Mrs Zainab revealed that Nigeria's economy is on positive track with third quarter Gross Domestic Products (GDP) growth at 2.38 per cent in year-on-year terms. According to the Minister a total of 34 out of 46 economic activities grew in this third quarter when compared to 2018, driven largely by the growth in the oil sector which grew by 6.47 per cent and the non oil sector rise by 1.85 per cent.
