Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu says plans for the regeneration of Lagos Island are already perfected and that implementation will commence next year. He made this disclosure Lagos when, on Wednesday, he visited Martins Street on the Lagos Island to sympathise with Balogun Market traders, following an inferno that completely razed a five-storey building in the market on Tuesday.  Governor Sanwo-Olu who noted that Lagos Island is dominated by buildings over a century old, said that those found to be weakened by old age will be eventually pulled down during the regeneration. The Governor said that families that own properties on the island must be prepared to support government's efforts on regeneration, and hinted that government will soon start a conversation on how to commence and proceed.  While addressing traders who lost property in the incident, Governor Sanwo-Olu commiserated with them and assured that government will build modern markets to ensure that commerce recommences at an even higher scale with a better organized and modern way of transacting business.  Our Correspondent Immanuel Odeyemi reports that the Governor who restated the need for people to desist from storing fossil fuels and explore other ways of using and storing electricity and power from other sources, disclosed that his administration was working with the two DISCOS in Lagos to further enhance supply of regular electricity power to the Island.
