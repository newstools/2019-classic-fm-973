President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the autonomy of state legislatures has been constrained by the constitution.  Receiving the Conference of Speakers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, President Buhari said the constitution upholds the standard for all public officers and institutional operations which must be adhered to, or altered to reflect some dynamics and realities of the country.  The President said his administration will keep pursuing the prosperity of all Nigerians by creating more jobs for the people, focus on health, education, infrastructure and plugging the weaknesses exploited by many to make quick money.  In his remarks, the Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, who is also the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, commended the President for the fight against corruption and insurgency, and efforts to ensure financial autonomy for the legislature and judiciary.  Obasa said the legislatures would be further pleased if the President issues an executive order directing the Accountant General of the Federation to separate funds for the state legislature and judiciary at the source.   The Conference of Speakers chairman also urged the President to consider supporting the devolution of powers to states on some issues on the exclusive list like railway and the police for more effective governance.
