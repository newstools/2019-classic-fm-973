The Federal Government has listed higher import revenue, lower domestic fuel consumption and increased rice production by local farmers among the gains of the closure of the country's land borders in four geo-political zones of the country.  The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who announced the gains when he visited the Seme Border on today, along with Minister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama; and other Ministers said since the closure, the monthly import revenue has increased by 15%, while the local consumption of fuel has dropped by 30%, due to reduced smuggling of the products to neighbouring countries.  The Minister put the value of items seized since the closure at over N3.5billion adding that 296 illegal immigrants have been arrested. He said Benin and Niger are not yet doing enough to ameliorate the challenges that led to the border closure, adding that the magnitude of seizures and the number of illegal immigrants recorded in the last two weeks alone confirm this assertion.  The Minister noted that the border closure would not have occurred if Nigeria's neighbours had complied with the various MOUs as well as the ECOWAS transit protocols, including the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS).
