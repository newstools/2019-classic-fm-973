Nigeria international goalkeeper Francis Uzoho who sustained a knee ligament in October has undergone successful surgery. The 20-year old suffered the injury after the hour mark during the Super Eagles' 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil in Singapore and had to be carried off on a stretcher.  "And it was a success. I'm grateful to every prayer and good wishes said. Even the hidden prayers said on my behalf," Uzoho wrote on social media. "I'm deeply grateful. Now let the healing begin."  He is expected to be out for at least six months and the injury comes as a setback for Uzoho, who had regained his starting place and had been picked for both of Nigeria's most recent friendly internationals against Ukraine and Brazil. His Cypriot club Omonia Nicosia has confirmed that the Nigerian was facing an extended lay-off due to the Injury.
