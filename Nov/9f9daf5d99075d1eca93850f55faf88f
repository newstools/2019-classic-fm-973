The Upper Legislative Chamber has summoned the Comptroller-General of the Nigerian Customs service over his directive stopping supply of petroleum products to filling stations within twenty-kilometers to the nationâ€™s borders.  In a motion moved by Senator Odebiyi Tolulope representing Ogun West and co-sponsored by Senator Francis Fadahunsi from Osun, the senate described the customs directive as a knee jerk approach to a modern problem.  And as a temporary palliative measure, the senate also asked the Nigerian customs to ensure a steady supply of petroleum products through identified suppliers and registered filing stations.  In his remarks, President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan, stressed the need to engage with the Customs authorities in the country for a holistic policy approach in the best interest of Nigerians.  Our Correspondent, Raliat Adenekan reports that the Upper Chamber also called on the customs boss to urgently explore usage of modern technology in tracking and scheduling petroleum trucks that undertake business along border towns.
