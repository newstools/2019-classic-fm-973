The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria’s  (NAHCON) Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Barr Abdullahi Mukhtar Muhammad expressed delight over the outcome of President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia for the Future Investment Initiative (FII). The Chairman commended the President’s foresight in taking far reaching decisions that hold positive impact for the entire country. The Commission is particularly interested on the benefits the agreements would translate to fellow Nigerians.  It would be recalled that the two leaders, President Muhammadu Buhari and Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman agreed on key issues among which is setting up of a joint Nigeria-Saudi Strategic Council with focus on economic development, investment in oil sector, security and counter-terrorism campaigns. The council, to comprise government officials and businessmen from the two countries, is to be formed within two months.  Barrister Muhammad expressed optimism that the milestone reached during the meetings will boost the existing amiable relationship between the two countries at micro and macroeconomic levels. It is only time that will reveal to Nigerians the full glory of the president’s mission and it is only time that will aid Nigerians in fully appreciating the president’s decisions, he emphasised.  The Commission’s Chairman praised the Saudi Crown Prince for the respect demonstrated to Nigeria by honouring President Muhammadu Buhari with a royal visit in the President’s hotel room instead of the other way round. He described the gesture as a mark of honour to Nigeria and respect to the President’s elderly status, a fundamental Islamic philosophy.  Barrister Mukhtar also commended the Saudi Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Adnan Bostaji for facilitating the meetings that culminated in the remarkable developments. He described his smooth coordination of the engagements from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia as exemplary of the Ambassador’s efficiency since assuming office in Nigeria.
