President Muhammadu Buhari has called on the National Assembly to fast-track the passage of the Special Crimes Court Bill.  Speaking at the National summit on ‘‘Diminishing Corruption in the Public Service’’ organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices  and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in collaboration with the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation in Abuja, the President also urged the judiciary to embrace and support the creation of Special Crimes Court.  Speaking on his recent directive to all agencies of government to enroll into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), the President directed ICPC to beam its searchlight on public institutions that are yet to comply.  He noted that the new directive on IPPIS was intended to halt the padding of personnel budgets and the diversion or misappropriation of capital budgets.
