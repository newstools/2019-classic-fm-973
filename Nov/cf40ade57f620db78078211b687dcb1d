Captain Tiger Woods has named himself as one of four wildcard selections for the US team at the Presidents Cup. He is only the second playing captain in the event between the US and an international team - Hale Irwin played in the inaugural matches 25 years ago. Woods, 43, also selected Tony Finau, Gary Woodland and Patrick Reed.  "As captain, I'm going to choose Tiger Woods as the last player on the team," he said, in announcing his own selection, before reeling off his Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup record. "And I find it interesting talking in the third person," he joked. Woods is also the first captain to pick himself for the Presidents Cup - Irwin qualified automatically for the event, which pits the US against a rest of the world team minus Europe, as one of the top eight-ranked US players at the time.  Since he returned in early 2018 from a fourth operation on his back, Woods has won three tournaments, including his 15th major at the Masters in April. In October, Woods equalled the PGA Tour record with his 82nd career victory at the Zozo Championship in Japan.
