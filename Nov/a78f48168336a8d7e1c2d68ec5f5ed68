The Golden Eaglets have crashed out of the U-17 FIFA World Cup after suffering a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands. Nothing seemed to work for the Eaglets, Manu Garbaâ€™s boys also equalled the record of conceding the highest goals by a Nigerian U-17 side after the 3-0 loss to France in the final of the 2001 edition and losing two consecutive matches.
