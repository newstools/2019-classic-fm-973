Seven Islamists have been sentenced to death for a 2016 attack on a cafe in the Bangladeshi capital in which 22 people, mostly foreigners, were killed. The attack on the Holey Artisan cafe in Dhaka was carried out by a group of five men, who took diners hostage. Eight people were on trial, accused of planning and supplying the attackers with weapons. One man was acquitted.  The 12-hour siege was Bangladesh's deadliest terrorist attack. Most of the victims were Italian or Japanese. One of the suspected masterminds of the attack, Nurul Islam Marzan, was killed in a shootout with anti-terrorism police in January 2017, authorities said. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, but Bangladesh disputed this, instead holding a local militant group responsible.  Since the attack, Bangladesh authorities have led a brutal crackdown on militants it sees as a destabilising force in the predominantly Muslim country. Public prosecutor Golam Sarwar Khan, speaking after the verdict was delivered, said the charges against the accused "were proved beyond any doubt".  The seven convicted men were accused of belonging to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), an outlawed group. Sentencing the men in Dhaka on Wednesday, a judge said they wanted to undermine public safety and create anarchy. "The court gave them the highest punishment," the prosecutor told reporters. Death sentences in Bangladesh are carried out by hanging. A defence lawyer said the seven men would appeal.  Some of the men shouted "Allahu Akbar" (an Arabic phrase meaning "God is greatest") as they were led away from the packed courtroom, AFP news agency reported.    The attack was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, but Bangladesh disputed this, instead holding a local militant group responsible.
