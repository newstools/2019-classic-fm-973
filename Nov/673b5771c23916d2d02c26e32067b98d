Small scale business owners, artisans, low income earners, and petty traders have been urged to key in to the Micro-Pension scheme as it would be of immense benefit to their businesses. President of the Pension Funds Operators of Nigeria (PENOP), Mrs. Ronke Adedeji made the call Friday on the sidelines of a media seminar organized by the body. Adedeji in an exclusive interview with our correspondent allayed the fears about the scheme, saying that it was a matter of time before those who key into it would start to see the benefits.  Speaking further, the PENOP President highlighted enlightenment of the prospective beneficiaries as a major factor that would determine the success and effectiveness of the Micro-Pension scheme. Adedeji said that though part of the problem was skepticism about safety of funds and related issues, proper education would disabuse the minds of those for whom the scheme was targeting.  Earlier, Head of Corporate Communications of the National Pension Commission; Mr. Peter Aghahowa, and Gurdian Newspaperâ€™s Head of Digital Media; Lolade Nwanze had delivered papers and fielded questions from the journalists representing various media organizations. Our Correspondent Immanuel Odeyemi reports that the Micro-Pension scheme which is designed to also incorporate workers in the informal sector of the economy, was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari in March, 2019.
