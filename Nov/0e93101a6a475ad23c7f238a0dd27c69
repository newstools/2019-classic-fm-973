"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me," he said in a press release. "Working with these players is what has attracted me."  According to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, " "In Jose, we have one of the most successful managers in football." "He (Mourinho) has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room," he added
