Gunmen have kidnapped a 13-year-old boy, Uzairu Basiru; 12 women, killed one person, with five others sustaining injuries in an attacked on Ruma community in Batsari Local Government Area of Katsina State.  This is just as President Muhammadu Buhari is billed to visit the camp of internally-displaced persons, IDPs, Wednesday, in Batsari. Community sources identified the deceased as Nasiru Ojo, saying the gunmen stormed the area at 10:30 p.m. on Monday night, shooting sporadically. The five persons injured were identified as Abu Karfe, Amadu Hasan, Ali Dan Asibi, Shamsu Yaâ€™u and Abu Danjari. They were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital.  Residents, reacting to the freedom with which the gunmen operated, expressed their displeasure with soldiers who troop into the area asking for help. Neither Katsina State Police Command nor Army is yet to make any official statement on the incident. As at press time, Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Anas Abdullahi, is yet to comment on the incident as he awaits confirmation from the DPO and Commissioner of Police.
