Angry youths and facilitators of the Revolution Now protest, Monday, defied threats of security agencies to hold demonstrations in four states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. States where the Revolution protests took place were Lagos, Osun, Ondo and Cross River.  The protest was, however, foiled in Edo and Oyo states. The Revolution protesters met combat-ready security operatives, who dispersed them as the demonstrations turned violent in Osun where a 70-year-old woman was brutalised.  In Lagos, a Revolution protester was shot, while nine other, including some journalists, were arrested by the police. The police had vowed to treat the ‘RevolutionNow’ protesters as terrorists, even though the group’s demands border largely on acute security and economic crises afflicting the nation. With the proposed nationwide demonstration held in only four states and Abuja, the Presidency, Monday, taunted the convener of the protest, saying the attempt to incite citizens into a revolution against their own democratic rights and interests has failed.  The Presidency in a statement in Abuja, signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the President Muhammadu Buhari and the government were humbled by the show of support by Nigerians not to participate in the alleged plot to remove a democratically elected government. This happened on a day calls for the release of Mr. Omoyele Sowore, the 2019 presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, AAC, and facilitator of the demonstrations reached feverish peak.  Nine presidential candidates and aspirants in the last election, including Dr Obadiah Mailafia, yesterday called for the immediate release of Sowore, who was arrested by the Department of State Services, DSS, on Saturday and had been detained since then.
